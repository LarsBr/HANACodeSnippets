-- This .sql contains the code to setup the SUDO_GRANT functionality in a HANA database.
-- Please see the blog post that explains the use case for this functionality and how it 
-- is implemented here.
--
-- Note that I don't recommend using this functionality in your system. It's presented here
-- for education purposes only.
-- If you do use it, it's at your own risk. If you aren't 100% sure about how using this function
-- will affect your landscape, then don't use it.

-- Make sure to read the blog post about the procedure: https://www.lbreddemann.org/sudo-grant/
